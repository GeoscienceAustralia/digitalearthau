Digital Earth Australia Sandbox
===============================

The Sandbox is a learning and analysis environment for getting started with
Digital Earth Australia and the Open Data Cube. It includes sample data and
Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the capability of the Open Data Cube.

Register
--------

The Sandbox is free to use. Visit https://app.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au to sign up
for a new account, or sign in if you have an existing account. A verification
code will be sent to the email address you register with.

Access
------

After signing in, the Sandbox will prepare a JupyterLab environment for you.
All necessary software is provided as part of this environment, so no additional
installation or configuration is required.

Navigate
--------

The JupyterLab interface consists of the main work area (right-hand panel), the
left sidebar (containing a file browser and other useful features), and a menu
bar along the top.

The main work area is where Jupyter notebooks will be displayed once opened. By
default, the Launcher is displayed, which allows you to open new files.

To open an existing Jupyter notebook, double-click through the folders to find a
notebook you're interested in, then double-click the notebook to
open it in the main work area. Notebooks are indicated by the ``.ipynb`` file
extension. The JupyterLab interface also supports plain text and Markdown files.

To learn more about JupyterLab, visit the `JupyterLab Documentation`_.

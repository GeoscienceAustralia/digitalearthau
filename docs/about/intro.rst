Introduction
============

Overview
--------

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) is a platform designed to:

* Catalogue large amounts of Earth Observation data
* Provide a :term:`Python` based :term:`API` for high performance querying and data access
* Give scientists and other users easy ability to perform Exploratory Data Analysis
* Allow scalable continent scale processing of the stored data
* Track the provenance of all the contained data to allow for quality control and updates


Background
----------
DEA will build on the globally recognised innovation, the `Australian Geoscience Data Cube`_
which was the winner of the 2016 Content Platform of the Year at the Geospatial World
Leadership Awards and was developed as a partnership between `Geoscience Australia`_ (GA),
the `Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation`_ (CSIRO) and the
`National Computational Infrastructure`_ (NCI).

Technology
----------
Digital Earth Australia is powered by `Open Data Cube`_, an open-source library for
management, analysis and processing of Earth observation (EO) satellite data.

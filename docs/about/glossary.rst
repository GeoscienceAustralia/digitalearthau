   AGDC
      The Australian Geoscience Data Cube, an Australian implementation of the
      ODC.

   API
      The Data Cube Application Programming Interface gives programmers full
      access to the capabilities of the Cube, allowing query and advanced data
      retrieval.

   NCI
      The Australian National Computational Infrastructure is Australia's
      national research computing facility. It provides computing facilities for
      use by Australian researchers, industry and government. For more
      information see http://www.nci.org.au/.
      
   ODC
      Open Data Cube, an international open-source project developing the technology
      that powers Digital Earth Australia. For more information see
      http://opendatacube.org/ .

   PostgreSQL
      The high performance database engine used as an index of Datasets by the
      Data Cube. It is both a relational and document database, and the Data
      Cube schema makes use of both of these capabilities.

   Python
      The programming language used to develop the Data Cube. It is easy to use
      while still allowing high performance access and processing capabilities.
      See http://www.python.org/ for more.

   VDI
      Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is a virtual laboratory at NCI that provides a
      linux desktop environment for scientific computing. For more see
      http://vdi.nci.org.au/help.

   YAML
      YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming
      languages. It is used for all on disk metadata files and product
      definitions in the Data Cube.

      For more information on the YAML standard see http://yaml.org/.

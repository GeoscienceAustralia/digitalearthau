Digital Earth Australia is currently in a private beta for Australian government and academic users
eligible for accounts on National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).

You can sign up with your government or academic institutional email address here:

https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/signup/

The easiest way to use Digital Earth Australia is to connect using a remote desktop at NCI,
called :term:`VDI`. (It is also possible to run on NCI's ``raijin`` HPC cluster, but is recommended
that you prototype on VDI first.)

Your NCI account will need to be linked to a VDI project. You can view your linked projects
at https://my.nci.org.au/.  If you do not already have access to a VDI project, you can request
to join the **wd8** project.  Once approved, you will be a member of the project and able to
access DEA through the VDI.

The DEA environment can also be accessed within the High Performance Computing (HPC) environment
(i.e. Raijin). This will require compute and storage quota allocations to be made via NCI's Allocation
Scheme processes, on a per-project basis.  This does not need to be specific to DEA â€“ all users with
computing capabilities on Raijin are able to access DEA through the HPC system.

This guide focuses on accessing and exploring DEA via the VDI environment.

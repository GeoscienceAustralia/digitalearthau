NCI Account Registration
************************


The Digital Earth Australia analysis environment is currently available for Australian government
and academic users eligible for accounts on National Computational
Infrastructure (NCI).

You can sign up with your government or academic institutional email address here:

https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/signup/

Commercial entities wanting to participate in project partnerships or training with DEA should contact
earth.observation@ga.gov.au.

NCI can also provision compute and storage resources to commercial entities under contract for those looking to
leverage DEA resources. It is suggested that commercial entities contact DEA in the first instance through
earth.observation@ga.gov.au to help determine requirements.

Virtual Desktop Analysis
------------------------

The easiest way to use Digital Earth Australia is to connect to a remote
desktop at NCI, called :term:`VDI`. (It is also possible to run on NCI's
``raijin`` HPC cluster, but is recommended that you prototype on VDI first.)

Your NCI account will need to be a member of a VDI project. You can view your
project memberships at https://my.nci.org.au/. If you do not already have access to
a VDI project, you can request to join the **wd8** project. Once approved, you
will be a member of the project and able to access DEA through the VDI.

Data Access
-----------

.. note::

    **Important Change, March 2019**

You now need to request membership of projects containing data you wish to access. Do this
by using the same process as joining a VDI Project as described above.

High Performance Computing
--------------------------

The DEA environment can also be accessed within the High Performance Computing
(HPC) environment (i.e. Raijin_). This will require compute and storage quota
allocations to be made via NCI's Allocation Scheme processes, on a per-project
basis. This does not need to be specific to DEA â€“ all users with computing
capabilities on Raijin are able to access DEA through the HPC system.

This guide focuses on accessing and exploring DEA via the VDI environment.

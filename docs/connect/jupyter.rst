Jupyter Notebook
================

**Executing a notebook**

The Digital Earth Australia link on your VDI desktop (described in Install step) will start Jupyter Notebooks in the dea_examples folder.
Here you will find the notebooks from the User Guide below, as well as the notebook *Digital Earth Australia.ipynb* which provides a brief introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks.

To run a notebook follow these steps:

* In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab.
* You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing **shift + enter**.
* You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu **Cell -> Run All**.
* To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu **Kernel -> Restart**. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etc...).

**Closing a notebook**

Simply closing the notebook browser tab, will not shut down its "computational engine" (called the kernel). To shut down a kernel, go to the associated notebook and click on menu **File -> Close and Halt**. Alternatively, the Notebook Dashboard has a tab named Running that shows all the running notebooks (i.e. kernels) and allows shutting them down (by clicking on a Shutdown button).

**Shutting down the Jupyter Notebook App**

Closing the browser (or the tab) will not close the Jupyter Notebook App. To completely shut it down you need to close the associated terminal.

For details on running Jupyter Notebooks, see http://jupyter.org/.

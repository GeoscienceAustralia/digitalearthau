  title: Fractional Cover 25 v2
  summary: 'The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote
    Sensing Research Program and is described in described in Scarth et al. (2010).
    It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from Landsat
    Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational
    Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated from terrain corrected
    surface reflectance (SR-NT_25_2.0.0).


    FC_25 provides a 25m scale fractional cover representation of the proportions
    of green vegetation, non-green vegetation, and bare surface cover across the Australian
    continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression
    estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares
    unmixing model. For further information please see the articles below describing
    the method implemented which are free to read:

    interaction - the role of Landsat fractional cover in time series analysis'',

    of pastures and agricultural areas in Queensland'', Proceedings of the 15th Australasian
    Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry Conference


    A summary of the algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Centre is also
    available from the AusCover website: http://www.auscover.org.au/purl/landsat-fractional-cover-jrsrp


    Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends
    and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind
    and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland
    condition. This information is used by policy agencies, natural and agricultural
    land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas
    over long time frames.'

    The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is
    described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort
    between The Department of Agriculture & ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional
    calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent.

    FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by
    the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure
    Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments.
